// Overview
// You’re tasked with creating a morse code translator using OOP. As an extension it should be
// able to translate based on user input from the DOM. Consider how you will store the morse
// characters in JS to make translation easier.

// The classes you use should store all the information needed to translate between Morse and
// English, including the alphabets themselves, the word to translate and possibly the eventual
// output as it’s changing.

// Some of the methods might include how to add a word to translate, how to break it down to aid
// the translation and you’ll have to think carefully about how and when you call these methods to
// make sure the state of the object is getting changed correctly.

// The logic for translating both ways won’t be exactly the same but some methods may be similar
// enough that you might be able to create a base class to extend from in order to share logic
// between the two translators (Morse => English, English => Morse).
// Remember to make a plan/pseudocode before diving right in.
